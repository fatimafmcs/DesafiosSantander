## Challenge Description

The application should compare the information from different sources and merge it into a single list with the fields "Movie Name," "Director," "Protagonists," and "Release Year."

The application should also allow, with a single click/request, to transfer the list to a PowerPoint presentation where each slide presents the "movie name," "director," and "release year."
